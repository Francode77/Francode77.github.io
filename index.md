<!-- ## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio

Hello! My name is Frank, and I set up this page to showcase some of the data science projects I've been working on.

At age 7, while working as a kid, I got my first computer, a Schneider CPC 6128. Actually my sister got it for school, but I more or less confiscated it to write a flight simulater and a synthesizer in BASIC 1.0, aside from playing the occasional Pong. I've still got it, though it's been a while since I used it's 128 kb memory and 3" floppy disks.

A game room with the newest ARCADE games, such as the original Pac-Man, Asteroids, Galaxian, Grand Prix, the first formule 1 game and tons more (Gun Smoke and 1942 to name a few)
 
After being a web developer for 20 years a new path needed to be taken. I became a data scientist student through a hands-on experience program for 7 months. With just 2 weeks vacation we worked on business cases and trained our knowledge in NLP, computer vision, classification and regression models. 

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me an [email](mailto: gmail.com) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/ ). 

Thanks for reading,

Frank
